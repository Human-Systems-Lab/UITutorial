# Getting Started with PyQt5

This example contains a minimal PyQt5 example application.  It contains the code required to
create a window, display it and then start processing the user interactions.

To run the application, you need to have a python environment setup with pyqt5 installed.
Once that is set up, run the main.py file to view the sample.
